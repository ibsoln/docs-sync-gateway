== Overview

THIS IS A WORK-IN-PROGRESS IN THIS BETA.

Couchbase Sync Gateway supports _{glos-term-inter-cluster-replication}_, {fn-icr} an increasingly important enterprise-level requirement that
supports _{glos-term-cloud-to-edge} synchronization_ use cases, where data changes must be synchronized between a centralized cloud cluster and a large number of edge clusters whilst still enforcing fine grained access control.

Inter-cluster replication provides the ability to run replications between:

* Sync Gateway clusters
* Active mobile clusters.

Sync Gateway's inter-cluster replication feature uses the SG-Replicate 2.0  protocol. It is an integral part of Sync Gateway, acting as the _{glos-term-active-replicator}_, pulling changes from a data source and pushing them to a target.

[[icr-architecture]]
.Inter-cluster replication architecture

====

All documents pass through the target Sync Gateway's _{glos-term-sync-function}_ instance, ensuring that access rules are honored. See: {xref-sgw-pg-adv-sgw-cfg-sync-function} for more on using `sync` functions)

In the architecture diagram (<<icr-architecture>>), any database changes made on either Sync Gateway instance are replicated to the other Sync Gateway instance, in accordance with the replication's configuration -- see {xref-sgw-pg-config-properties-db-replications} for configuration detail.


// == Feature Summary

// * Replication use cases include (see <<typical-use-cases>>):
// ** Mobile cluster replications
// ** Cloud-edge/hub-spoke replication
// * {xref-sgw-pg-icr-high-availability} (HA)
// * {xref-sgw-pg-icr-delta-sync} option
// * Create flexible replications using Sync Gateway's REST API -- see: {xref-sgw-pg-adv-rest-api-client}
// * Scalability
// * JSON configuration to specify replications
// * Supports multiple replications running concurrently
// * Supports multiple replication types: _{glos-term-persistent-replication}_ and _{glos-term-transient-replication}_ -- see {xref-sgw-pg-icr-replication-types}
// * Leverages the full duplex nature of websockets to support push and pull from a single connection -- see {xref-sgw-pg-config-properties-db-rep-direction}
// * Does not store anything persistently
// * Stateless -- can be interrupted/restarted anytime without negative side effects
// * Can specify which channel(s) to sync
// * Supports Primary/Primary and Primary/Secondary topologies

== Use Cases

Cloud-to-edge synchronization::
+
--
In this multi-cloud deployment mode large numbers of multiple edge clusters sync with one or more clusters in cloud data centers. Each edge can operate autonomously without network connectivity to the cloud data centers {fn-arch}.

SG-Replicate 2.0 delivers bi-directional sync, which:

- is scalable
- has high availability
- features automatic and customizable conflict resolution options
- has end-to-end security with fine grained access control.

All very important considerations in this use case.

A typical architecture for this use cases is shown in <<icr-cloud-to-edge>>

.Cloud-to-edge synchronization
image::icr-cloud-to-edge.svg[]
--

Active-to-active Mobile Synchronization::
+
--
The performant SG-Replicate 2.0 protocol is also ideal where Sync Gateway deployments require data replication between active mobile clusters.

A typical architecture for this use cases is shown in <<icr-active-mobile>>

[[icr-active-mobile]]
.Active-active mobile synchronization
image::icr-active-mobile-sync.svg[]

--

Alternative Methods::
+
--
xref:server:manage:manage-xdcr/xdcr-management-overview.adoc[XDCR] (cross data centre replication) is the Couchbase Server API to replicate between Couchbase Server clusters.

Both XDCR and SG Replicate 2.0 can be used to keep clusters in different data centres in sync.
However, SG Replicate 2.0 was designed specifically for Couchbase Mobile deployments and must be used for replication between mobile clusters.
--

// == Constraints

// SG-Replicate 2.0 will only replicate Sync Gateway databases hosted on versions of Sync Gateway later than March 7, 2014.

// High availability::
// +
// --
// In clusters containing multiple Sync Gateway nodes, only _one_ of the Sync Gateways should be configured fas the replicating node.

// Configuring multiple Sync Gateways as replicating nodes can substantially increase the amount of duplicate work, and therefore should be avoided.

// This limitation means the system cannot be guaranteed as Highly Available. If the replicating Sync Gateway fails or is otherwise removed from the system, then the replications will stop.
// --

== Administration

include::page${sgw-pg-icr-admin}[tag=overview]

See: {xref-sgw-pg-icr-admin}


== Monitoring Replications

* Use `_replicationStatus` to monitor SG-Replicate 2.0 replications  (`GET`).
* Use `_active_tasks` to monitor SG-Replicate 1.0 replications  (`GET`)
+
The content returned will be the same as that returned by `_replicationStatus` and contains additional content over the SG-Replicate 1.0 version:
+
** direction
** is_persistent
** status (stopped/running).
** last_seq_push
** last_seq_pull

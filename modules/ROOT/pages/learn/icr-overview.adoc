== Introducing Inter-cluster Replication

Couchbase Sync Gateway supports _{glos-term-inter-cluster-replication}_, an increasingly important enterprise-level requirement that
supports _{glos-term-cloud-to-edge} synchronization_ use cases, where data changes must be synchronized between a centralized cloud cluster and a large number of edge clusters whilst still enforcing fine grained access control.

Inter-cluster repliaction provides the ability to run replications between:

Couchbase Sync Gateway supports _{glos-term-inter-cluster-replication}_, {fn-icr} an increasingly important enterprise-level requirement that
supports _{glos-term-cloud-to-edge} synchronization_ use cases, where data changes must be synchronized between a centralized cloud cluster and a large number of edge clusters whilst still enforcing fine grained access control.

Inter-cluster replication provides the ability to run replications between:

* Sync Gateway clusters
* Active mobile clusters.

Sync Gateway's inter-cluster replication feature uses the SG-Replicate 2.0  protocol. It is an integral part of Sync Gateway, acting as the _{glos-term-active-replicator}_, pulling changes from a data source and pushing them to a target.

All documents pass through the target Sync Gateway's _{glos-term-sync-function}_ instance, ensuring that access rules are honored. See: {xref-sgw-pg-adv-sgw-cfg-sync-function} for more on using `sync` functions)

In the architecture diagram (<<icr-architecture>>), any database changes made on either Sync Gateway instance are replicated to the other Sync Gateway instance, in accordance with the replication's configuration -- see {xref-sgw-pg-config-properties-db-replications} for configuration detail.


// == Feature Summary

// * Replication use cases include (see <<typical-use-cases>>):
// ** Mobile cluster replications
// ** Cloud-edge/hub-spoke replication
// * {xref-sgw-pg-icr-high-availability} (HA)
// * {xref-sgw-pg-icr-delta-sync} option
// * Create flexible replications using Sync Gateway's REST API -- see: {xref-sgw-pg-adv-rest-api-client}
// * Scalability
// * JSON configuration to specify replications
// * Supports multiple replications running concurrently
// * Supports multiple replication types: _{glos-term-persistent-replication}_ and _{glos-term-transient-replication}_ -- see {xref-sgw-pg-icr-replication-types}
// * Leverages the full duplex nature of websockets to support push and pull from a single connection -- see {xref-sgw-pg-config-properties-db-rep-direction}
// * Does not store anything persistently
// * Stateless -- can be interrupted/restarted anytime without negative side effects
// * Can specify which channel(s) to sync
// * Supports Primary/Primary and Primary/Secondary topologies

Sync Gateway



== Replication Types

Sync Gateway supports two replication types

Persistent::
+
--
All replications are persistent unless they are dynamically created as transient using the REST API and setting `adhoc=true`.

Persistent replications survive Sync Gateway node restarts.

These replications are created by configuring them in the {xref-sgw-pg-config-properties} file or by using the {xref-sgw-pg-rest-api-admin} endpoint {xref-sgw-endpoint-admin-api-replication-put}. This is the recommended way to create replications in a production environment.

Once created these replications will automatically start whenever Sync GAteway is restarted.

This is the default replication-type.
--

Transient (adhoc)::
+
--
Transient replications exist only for the period of the replication. Once created -- using the Admin Rest API -- and run to 'stopped' status, they are automatically removed.

These replications always start in 'running' state.
Despite their transient name, they do survive restarts but *only if* they are in a 'running' state when Sync Gateway is restarted

Transient replications are not guaranteed to run on the node on which they start as they will be distributed across available nodes -- see <<high-availability-replication>> for why this happens.

Replications reach the 'stopped' state either on completion, or as a result of a user actively changing the state (for example by using the {xref-sgw-endpoint-admin-api-replication-repstatus-set}
 endpoint).

Transient (adhoc) replications provide a convenient way to:

* Run one off replications (for example, when troubleshooting)
* Run on-demand replications after Sync Gateway is started.
For instance a replication that needs to be to be run only periodically can be configured as an adhoc replication by an automated script scheduled to run when needed.

== Use Cases

Cloud-to-edge synchronization::
+
--
In this multi-cloud deployment mode large numbers of multiple edge clusters sync with one or more clusters in cloud data centers. Each edge can operate autonomously without network connectivity to the cloud data centers {fn-arch}.

SG-Replicate 2.0 delivers bi-directional sync, which:

- is scalable
- has high availability
- features automatic and customizable conflict resolution options
- has end-to-end security with fine grained access control.

All very important considerations in this use case.

A typical architecture for this use cases is shown in <<icr-cloud-to-edge>>

[[icr-cloud-to-edge]]
.Cloud-to-edge synchronization
image::icr-cloud-to-edge200712.svg[,600]
--

Active-to-active Mobile Synchronization::
+
--
The performant SG-Replicate 2.0 protocol is also ideal where Sync Gateway deployments require data replication between active mobile clusters.

A typical architecture for this use cases is shown in <<icr-active-mobile>>

[[icr-active-mobile]]
.Active-active mobile synchronization
image::icr-active-mobile-sync200713.svg[,600]

--

Alternative Methods::
+
--
xref:server:manage:manage-xdcr/xdcr-management-overview.adoc[XDCR] (cross data centre replication) is the Couchbase Server API to replicate between Couchbase Server clusters.

Both XDCR and SG Replicate 2.0 can be used to keep clusters in different data centres in sync.
However, SG Replicate 2.0 was designed specifically for Couchbase Mobile deployments and must be used for replication between mobile clusters.
--

// == Constraints

// SG-Replicate 2.0 will only replicate Sync Gateway databases hosted on versions of Sync Gateway later than March 7, 2014.

// High availability::
// +
// --
// In clusters containing multiple Sync Gateway nodes, only _one_ of the Sync Gateways should be configured fas the replicating node.

// Configuring multiple Sync Gateways as replicating nodes can substantially increase the amount of duplicate work, and therefore should be avoided.

// This limitation means the system cannot be guaranteed as Highly Available. If the replicating Sync Gateway fails or is otherwise removed from the system, then the replications will stop.

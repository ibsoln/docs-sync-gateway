== Overview
// tag::overview[]
SG-Replicate 2.0 replication supports automatic conflict resolution to resolve conflicting document changes (revisions).
It delivers this using a flexible policy-driven mechanism, which automatically detects and resolves document conflicts under replication.

As soon as the _active_ Sync Gateway database detects a conflict in a replicated document revision, it applies a specified <<resolver-policies, resolver policy>>. This policy assesses the conflicting revisions and either determines the winning revision or returns an error if it fails while doing so.

Four <<resolver-policies, conflict resolver policies>> are available out-of-the-box. Three can be easily applied to Sync Gateway replications to give automatic resolution. the fourth is a _custom_ policy, which provides additional flexibility allowing users to provide their own resolution logic.

Automatic conflict resolution applies only in {enterprise} licensed deployments.
// end::overview[]

== Automatic Conflict Resolution

When an active Sync Gateway database detects a conflict in replicated document revisions, it calls and applies its configured <<resolver-policies, resolver policy>> to determine a _winning_ revision.
It will return an error if this process fails.

When a passive Sync Gateway database detects a conflict it responds to the active with a `409` response and rejects the revision. The active Sync Gateway will then apply its specified conflict resolver policy.

//  even when the no-conflicts mode is enabled (that is where xref:config-properties.adoc#databases-foo_db-allow_conflicts["allow_conflicts": false]).

// When running two Sync Gateway clusters with the no-conflicts mode enabled, cross-cluster document conflicts will result in that document no longer being replicated. To avoid this, the application must ensure that concurrent cross-cluster updates are not made to a given document.

// Deployments  must implement a custom conflict resolver in an external app as specified in {xref-sgw-pg-resolving-conflicts}.

NOTE: SG-Replicate 1.0 replications do not support conflict resolution. You should set `allow_conflict=true` on both the `source` and `target`.

== Resolver Policies
SG-Replicate 2.0 supports four out-of-the-box (predefined) conflict resolver policies. Three policies offer automatic conflict resolution as described in <<#predefined-resolver-policies>>, the fourth policy is described in <<custom-conflict-resolution>>.

[#predefined-resolver-policies]
.Predefined resolver policies
The following automatic conflict resolution policies are available when configuring a replication:

Default::
The default automatic resolution policy always returns a winner determined by the following rules:
// * Deletes always win.
* If one revision is a delete (tombstone), that is the winner.
* If both revisions are deletes then the delete with the longest revision history (most revisions) wins. In short the delete with the highest revision Id wins.
* If neither revision is a delete then the revision with the longest revision history (most revisions) wins.
* Configured using: `"conflict_resolution_type": "useDefault"`.

Local Wins::
* Always considers the local change the winner.
* Configured using: `"conflict_resolution_type": "localWins"`

Remote Wins::
Always considers the remote change the winner.
* Configured using: `"conflict_resolution_type": "remoteWins"`

These predefined policies are also available as Javascript functions that you can call from within a _custom_conflict_resolver_ function -- see <<custom-conflict-resolution>>

== How Resolution Works

Pull Replications::
+
For _Pull_ replications the _active_ Sync Gateway is responsible for detecting and resolving conflicts based on the configured _conflict_resolution_type_  and _custom_conflict_resolver_ function (see configuration items: {xref-sgw-pg-config-properties-db-rep-conflict} | {xref-sgw-pg-config-properties-db-rep-resolver}).
+
This is also how conflicts are handled when Couchbase Lite clients pull down documents to Sync Gateway.
+
*Note:* Resolved conflicts are only transferred from active to passive Sync Gateways if a replication is setup between them.

Push Replications::
+
--
Passive Sync Gateway::
For _Push_ replications, the _passive_ Sync Gateway automatically detects and rejects conflicting changes being pushed to it.
+
Note that conflicts are not resolved.
The revision is rejected and the document returned -- with a `409 Conflict` -- response to the active Sync Gateway.

Active Sync Gateway::
It is  the responsibility of the active sync Gateway to address rejected revisions in accordance with its specified _conflict_resolution_type_.
+
This approach is the same as that adopted when Couchbase Lite clients push documents to Sync Gateway.
--

== Configuring a Policy to Use
To invoke automatic conflict resolution, simply specify the required policy in the replication definition.
The specified conflict resolver policy will be applied by the active Sync Gateway whenever a conflict is detected during replication.

// SG-Replicate 2.0 supports automatic conflict resolution to resolve conflicting document revisions.

// The automatic conflict resolution policy is the same as that adopted in Couchbase Lite 2.x between Couchbase Lite and Sync Gateway.
// The basic rules being:

// include::couchbase-lite:ROOT:partial$handling-conflicts.adoc[tags=auto-conflict-resolution]

== Custom Conflict Resolution

Custom conflict resolution is handled by the _active_ Sync Gateway using a user-provided _custom conflict resolver_. This Javascript function is embedded in the replication configuration.

There are two ways to handle conflicts in your custom_conflict_resolver, you can either:

* Choose a _winning_ revision from among the conflicting revisions (see <<simple-conflict-resolvers>>), or
* Merge conflicting revision to create a new _winning_ revision; losing revisions are tomb-stoned.
+
However, user are cautioned against using complex resolver logic as it can have a significant impact on performance.

The _passive_ Sync Gateway will automatically detect and reject conflicting revisions being pushed to it.
These conflicts are not resolved by the passive Sync Gateway. Instead the revision is rejected and the document returned to the _active_ Sync Gateway in a with a `409 Conflict` response.

This approach is the same as that adopted when Couchbase Lite clients push documents to Sync Gateway.

You can invoke the non-custom built-in resolver policies from within your resolver function. This is useful when you want to apply greater selectivity to the automatic conflict resolution process. For example, you want to apply the `remoteWins` policy only for a specific type of document - see <<use-policies, Use Policies>> tab in <<simple-conflict-resolvers>>.

== Conflict Resolver Structure

[source, javascript]
----
//
function (local, remote) { // <.>
	// TODO: Determine winner using built-in or custom policy
	return { // <.>
		body: winner.body,
		meta: winner.meta
	}; // Return winning revision
}
----

<.> *Parameters*
+
--
local::
This _local_ object encapsulates the body and metadata of the local conflicting document revision being replicated. Its content matches the JSON stored at the local Sync Gateway.
+
remote::
The _remote_ object, encapsulates the body and metadata of the remote conflicting document revision being replicated. Its content matches the JSON stored at the remote Sync Gateway.
--

<.> *Return object*
+
--
body::
Set the _body_ object of the winning document revision to contain the _body_ content of the JSON body of either the local, or remote, document revisions.
+
meta::
This is the Metadata of the winning document revision. Set it to the content of the JSON body of either the local, or remote, document metadata.

This example uses the built-in resolver functions to resolve the conflict based-on the document type.

So, documents of type `a-doc-type-1` are always resolved in favor of the remote revision. All other document types are resolved in accordance with the default resolver policy.

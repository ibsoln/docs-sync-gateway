== Introduction

Access Grants are one of the cornerstone concepts behind {sgw}'s access control feature.

You can grant users access to specific documents and channels based on the contents of the document being processed by the Sync Function.
Alternatively, as an added level of security, you can instead nominate a specific xattr to determine the access grants.

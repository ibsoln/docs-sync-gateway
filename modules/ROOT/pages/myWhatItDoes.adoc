== What is Sync Gateway?

Sync Gateway is the synchronization server in a Couchbase Mobile deployment.
It provides data synchronization for large-scale interactive web, mobile, and IoT applications. This is illustrated in  <<couchbase-mobile-couchbase-server-deployment-architecture>>, which shows a Sync Gateway cluster replicating changes between:

// * 'locally' between edge-devices to keep each in sync
* connected mobile/edge devices and a cloud-based Couchbase Server cluster
* itself and other edge-based Sync Gateway clusters (inter-cluster replication).

You can read more about the mobile replication process in {xref-sgw-pg-shared-bucket-access}, whilst inter-cluster replication is covered in {xref-sgw-pg-icr-overview}.


Amongst its most important and commonly used features is secure **Access Control**.

Sync Gateway assures secure access control using:

* **User authentication**, which ensures that only authorized users can connect to Sync Gateway.
For more information see the
{xref-sgw-pg-users-and-roles} and {xref-sgw-pg-authentication} content.
+
* *Data Routing*, which ensures that authorized users can only access documents in those {xref-sgw-pg-sync-gateway-channels} assigned to them and only in accordance with their assigned privileges.
You can set those privileges to confer {xref-sgw-pg-read-access} and-or {xref-sgw-pg-write-access} as required.
+
The business logic behind the validation and authorization of document access is provided by the customizable {xref-sgw-pg-adv-sgw-cfg-sync-function}.

=== Creating an RBAC user

In order for Sync Gateway to connect to Couchbase Server, you must create an RBAC user.
The RBAC user credentials will be used in a later section to start Sync Gateway.

. Open the *Security* tab and click the *Add User* button.

. The steps to create the RBAC user differ slightly depending on the version of Couchbase Server that you have installed. We explain the differences below.

[{tabs}]
====
Couchbase Server 5.5 or above::
+
In the pop-up window, provide a *Username* (`sync_gateway`) and *Password* (`password`).
Those credentials will be used by Sync Gateway to connect to Couchbase Server (in the <<configure-sync-gateway>> section).
You must grant RBAC roles to that user.
If you are using Couchbase Server 5.5 or above, you must enable the *Application Access* and *Read Only Admin* roles as shown on the image below.

Couchbase Server 5.1::
+
In the pop-up window, provide a *Username* and *Password*, those credentials will be used by Sync Gateway to connect later on.
Next, you must grant RBAC roles to that user.
If you are using Couchbase Server 5.1, you must enable the *Bucket Full Access* and *Read Only Admin* roles.

=== Network access

If you're installing Couchbase Server on the cloud, make sure that network permissions (or firewall settings) allow incoming connections to Couchbase Server ports.
In a typical mobile deployment on premise or in the cloud (AWS, Red Hat, etc.), the following ports must be opened on the host for Couchbase Server to operate correctly: 8091, 8092, 8093, 8094, 11207, 11210, 11211, 18091, 18092, 18093.
You must verify that any firewall configuration allows communication on the specified ports.
If this is not done, the Couchbase Server node can experience difficulty joining a cluster.
You can refer to the xref:server:install:install-ports.adoc[Couchbase Server Network Configuration] guide to see the full list of available ports and their associated services.

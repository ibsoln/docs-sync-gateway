.Access Control Model
image:access-control-triangle.png[Access,400]

Every {user--xref} and {role--xref} is granted access to zero, one or more {channels--xref}.
It is this channels list that determines the documents users can access -- as illustrated in <<img-access-control-model>>

A user can only read documents that are in at least one of their assigned channels; whether directly or as part of an assigned role.

NOTE: All users can implicitly access any document in the {channels--xref-public-channel}

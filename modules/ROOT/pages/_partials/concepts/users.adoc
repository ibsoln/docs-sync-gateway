Users are one of the cornerstone concepts of access control.
You can restrict document access to specific users and-or to users with specific roles.

As an entity a _user_ comprises a name, password, list of {roles--xref} and a list of {channels--xref}.

NOTE: Sync Gateway users and roles have no relationship to Couchbase Server's xref:server:learn:security/authorization-overview.adoc[RBAC (Role-base Access Control) users].

Users that are granted access to a channel are able to access the documents assigned to that channel.

Users can also be assigned to zero or more roles.
A user inherits the channel access of all roles it belongs to.
This is very much like Unix groups, except that roles do not form a hierarchy.

Roles are named collections of {channels--xref}.
They enable the grouping togethers of {Users--xref} with similar characteristics, which makes the management of large user populations easier.

Roles are granted access to channels.
Any user assigned a role can access any channels (and documents within those channels) the role has been granted access to.

As an entity roles comprises a name and a list of channels.

Any user associated with a role inherits the right to access any of the channels in the role's list.
This provides a convenient way to associate multiple channels with multiple users.

TIP: Roles have a separate namespace from users, so it's possible to have a user and a role with the same name.

You can add and remove roles from users using either the {rest-api-admin--xref} or {configuration-schema-static--xref}.

Note that removing a role effectively revokes access to the channel that role is associated with and may mean users will lose access to required documents.
